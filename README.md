# VectorJS


Hello, this is my free to use Vector project!


It has Vector logic like additionn distance calculation and so on.


Initialize a Vector using the new keyword:

const vector = new Vector();


In the brackets are the values of the dimensions:

const vector = new Vector(2, 3);


It can have zero to four dimensions:

const vector0 = new Vector();

const vector1 = new Vector(2);

const vector2 = new Vector(2, 5);

const vector3 = new Vector(2, 5, 0);

const vector4 = new Vector(2, 5, 0, -4);


You can use operations.

Note that multiplications and divisions behave as shown:


const vecA = new Vector(1, 2);

const vecB = new Vector(2, 3);

let solution;


vecA ["+="] (vecB) ["+"] (0, 1);


vecA ["*="] (1, 2); // multiply x by 1 and y by 2

vecA ["/="] (2); // divide every value by 2

vecA ["/="] (new Vector(2)); // divide the x value by 2


vecA ["-="] (2);

solution = vecA ["+"] (vecB);
