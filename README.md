# VectorJS

## What is this?

VectorJS is a free to use Vector math system for your JavaScript programs.<br>
It has fancy syntax that is easy to learn.
<br><br><br>

## Basics

Here is how you create a vector:

```JavaScript
const vec = new Vector(1, 2); // The first value x is 0 and y is 2
```
The Vectors can have 0 dimensions up to 4 dimensions:
```JavaScript
const vec_0 = new Vector();
const vec_4 = new Vector(1, 2, 3, 4);
```
As you will see later, multiple inputs will count as a Vector:
```JavaScript
(vec) // variables that are Vectors
(new Vector(4, 1, 3)) // new Vectors
(0, 3) // Numbers only in the brackets
({x: 6, y: 4}) // Objects
```
<br><br>



## Operations

Simply write your operation into a string in square brackets:
```JavaScript
const vec_a = new Vector(1, 2);
const vec_b = new Vector(3, 4);
const vec_c = vec_a ["+"] (vec_b); // vec_c is now (4, 6)
```

To increase a vectors value, use "+=":
```JavaScript
const vec = new Vector(1, 2);
vec ["+="] (2, 2); // vec_c is now (3, 4)
```
<br><br>



## Additional Functions

In the following code, you will see all the additional functions.
<br><br>

### Dimensions:
```JavaScript
const vec = new Vector(1, 2, 3, 4);

// get dimesions
vec ["dm"] (); // (returns 4)

// set dimensions
vec ["dm"] (2); // (returns 2), vec is now (1, 2)

vec ["dm"] (4) // vec is now (1, 2, 0, 0)

vec ["dm"] (0) // vec is now ()
```
<br>

### Distances:
Normal:
```JavaScript
const vec_a = new Vector(1, 0);
const vec_b = new Vector(0, 0);

const dist = vec_a ["dist"] (vec_b); // dist is 1
```
With different dimensions:
```JavaScript
const vec_a = new Vector(1, 1);
const vec_b = new Vector(1); // gets treated as (1, 0)

const dist = vec_a ["dist"] (vec_b); // dist is 1
```
